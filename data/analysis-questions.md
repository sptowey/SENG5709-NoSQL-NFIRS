## 3.1.3.4 Challenging Questions with Cross-Referenced Data
These questions are unable to be answered with the dataset available. However, they could be answered by analyzing results through the lens of our intuition, or additional datasets could be located to find the supporting data required. These advanced scenarios will be addressed only if time allows.  
- Do the fires happen more readily in arid areas versus more precipitous areas?  
- Were there increases in the number of fires where a drought occurred?  
- Did the number of fires and the location, especially affluent areas, have the highest property damage recorded?
